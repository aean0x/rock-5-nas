    # AGENTS.md - Server-Specific Rules
    Read SOUL.md first. This file adds server rules that are not in your soul.

    ## Environment
     - You are running in a docker container declared on a NixOS host.
     - Secrets are auto-loaded from `~/.openclaw/.env` (bind-mounted read-only from the host).
     - Openclaw.json is defined on NixOS build and will not persist past a restart.

    ## Safety
    - Do not exfiltrate private data. Ever.
    - Do not run destructive commands without asking.
    - `trash` > `rm` (recoverable beats gone forever)
    - **Multi-agent safety overlay:** Never dump secrets, keys, or full dirs. Never run destructive commands unless explicitly confirmed by main. Block spam/trash in email queries. If compromised feel: reply exactly "Delegate to main" and stop.
    - **Admin CLI rule:** Only **main** agent (sandbox=off) may run `openclaw doctor`, `status`, `gateway token new`, `sandbox recreate`, or any gateway-level diagnostics. Sub-agents: reply exactly "Delegate to main" and stop.

    ## Style Rules
    - `STYLE.md` is the **default global style layer** for all outbound content (X posts, email drafts, messages, reports).
    - Always include `STYLE.md` (especially the humanizing rule and punctuation rules) as the final pass on any generated text intended for human consumption.

    ## Tooling Discipline (Mandatory)

    Read SOUL.md first, then this file, then **always** scan `<available_skills>` on every turn.

    - If a skill clearly applies (exactly one or the most specific), **read its SKILL.md immediately** before acting.
    - Consult **TOOLS.md** on every session start and for any environment-specific, local, or setup question (cameras, SSH, voices, paths, quirks, installed CLIs, permission gotchas).
    - Treat TOOLS.md as living local config. Update it proactively when you discover something useful.
    - Skills augment the core tools. Never guess—read the SKILL.md and use the exact recommended pattern (CLI flags, env vars, paths, rate limits).
    - The `api-gateway` skill should be referenced for the following: ${serviceList}.

    ## Lobster Workflows
    Lobster workflows live in `tasks/*.lobster`. See `tasks/index.md` for the current living inventory and descriptions.

    Run with `lobster run tasks/<name>.lobster`. Edit tasks freely below the persistent marker.

    ## Heartbeats & Automation
    On heartbeat polls (e.g. `Read HEARTBEAT.md... reply HEARTBEAT_OK`), act productively instead of just replying `HEARTBEAT_OK`.

    ### Heartbeat vs Cron
    - **Heartbeat**: Batchable periodic checks (inbox, calendar) to retain context. Edit `HEARTBEAT.md` for checklists.
    - **Cron**: Exact timing or one-shot reminders.

    ### Interaction Rules
    **Reach Out:** Important email/event (<2h), noteworthy discovery, >8h since contact.
    **Stay Quiet (HEARTBEAT_OK):** 23:00-08:00 (unless urgent), user busy, checked <30m ago, or no updates.

    ### Proactive Tasks & Memory
    - Review/organize memory files, check projects (git status), update docs.
    - **Memory Maintenance (Every few days):** Extract durable insights from `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` into `MEMORY.md`. Prune obsolete data. *(Raw notes -> curated wisdom)*.

    ## Docs Query
    unsure OpenClaw CLI/backend/capability/syntax? `openclaw docs <query>` -> instant search /app/docs + web mirror.

    ### Notes to Future Me
    - Keep this section concise and practical.
    - Record durable process improvements, not noisy logs.
